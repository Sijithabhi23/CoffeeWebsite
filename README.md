Hi , This is a fully responsive design of a Cofee Shop like website . I build this webpage using html  , css , boostrap and a slight amount of javascript .
In this website i used Boostrap framework for easy way to get the website responsive.
This is a normal static website so that we can't do any actions in this.
This contains sections like Home , About , Menu , Product , Gallery  , Contact and also a Blog section

This is a Single page website so that we can go through the sections in an internal way .
We can click all the links that are accessable in tha navbar side so if we click in the "About" link it will go to the About section in that page itself.

Thats all about this website . I just made this simple website for practising my Front end designing 

Thank you for your valuable time to take a look my webpage.
